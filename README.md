# NasiToys Website Development

## Overview
A sorta mock site I am making for a friend I know. Their site is [here](https://nasitoys.com/) for reference. I kept the green style but wanted to go for something more modern and more open in comparison to the original site. I used JS to generated the html of the pages from the dropdown instead of making a bunch of different HTML's. Overall I'm really happy with the look and layout of the site and I am very happy with the code for my current skill.
